# Jamf Multi-Tenant API Tools

## About

This repo contains a set of bash scripts that are designed to propagate things across a set of Jamf servers (hereafter "instances"). Potentially uniquely, it has the ability to perform an action on any number of Jamf servers, from one, to multiple, to all in a list.

`jocads.sh` is a special script which is designed to be able to copy items from one instance to one or multiple others. It can copy mutiple items at once from a source instance to any number of other instances.

`migration-tool.sh` is also a special script that can copy all API endpoints from one instance to another, primarily useful for populating a fresh instance.

The other scripts are designed to perform a single action on one or multiple instances.

These scripts are adaptations of previously internal scripts I created while working at ETH ZÃ¼rich for use on a set of on-premises servers which have a common SMB repo for packages. This open source version is an attempt to adapt the scripts for a wider use. I did update the script for use with cloud servers over the months before leaving that job, but bear in mind that it has primarily only been tried out on self-hosted servers.
